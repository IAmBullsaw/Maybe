##Maybe - Python
Ok, so this is the pyhon version.
**Disclaimer - I am very tired right now. Errors might be present.**

     m = Maybe(n = 0.5) #returns a maybe objet with a truthPercent of n 
     m == True #Checks if true
     m == False #,,,,
     m2 = Maybe() #...
     m == m2 # You can compare one maybe with another. Huzzah!
     m.update(n = None) # Updates with set truth percent if any given.
     
That's about it for now. 

Yay.
